 *    Usage of an IANA media type like 'application/octet-stream' should be assumed to

 *  - The server may allow the client to choose a specific response format by
 *    specifying an 'Accept' header in the request, such as 'application/vnd.apache.parquet'
 *    or 'application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream'. If multiple types are requested and
 *    supported by the server, the choice of which to use is server-specific. If
 *    none of the requested content-types are supported, the server may respond with
 *    either 406 (Not Acceptable) or 415 (Unsupported Media Type), or successfully
 *    respond with a different format that it does support along with the correct
 *    'Content-Type' header.
